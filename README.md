# Ripple Carry Adder

A Ripple Carry Adder (RCA) is a basic digital circuit used to add binary numbers. 

- It adds bits sequentially, starting from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB)
- The carry-out from each stage acts as the carry-in for the subsequent stage.
- While simple, it can be slow for large numbers due to carry propagation delays.

Here, four bit numbers are added using RCA.
